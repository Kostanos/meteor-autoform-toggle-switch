# meteor-autoform-toggle-switch
Add support of CSS toggle switch to autoform in Meteor

## Prerequesites
* You'll need to add CSS toggle switch to the project
```
meteor add kostanos:meteor-css-toggle-switch
```

## TODO
* Add support for array of values
* Currently adapted to bootstrap only
* There is annoyed padding, hopefully CSS toggle switch will remove it (https://github.com/ghinda/css-toggle-switch/issues/45)
